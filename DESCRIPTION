Title: binomial regression model with a link function
Version: 0.9.1.4
Author: Chao Zhu
Maintainer: Chao Zhu <chao.zhu@utas.edu.au>
Description: Fit a binomial regression model (bm) with a link function 
  by Exact method.The boundary of parameter space in log and identity link 
  binomial model causes trouble to locate a maximum likelihood solution
  and fails to converge when it is close to or on the boundary of space.
  Exact method utilizes the property of boundary vectors to re-parametrize
  the model without losing any information, and fits the model with no
  convergence issues.
